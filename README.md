# Adult-Dataset
This is a small demo project on data preprocessing and random forest classifier. I use Adult dataset for this project. The main goal of this project is to 
properly preprocess the data and build a random forest classifier that can predict the income class of an individual. 

## Packages Used:
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) sklearn
4) matplotlib
5) seaborn
